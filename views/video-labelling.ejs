                    <h2>Object Recognition and Tracking</h2>
                    <p class="tech-text">Object Recognition and Tracking is a fundamental feature in video labelling that involves identifying and tracking specific objects or entities within video footage. This feature utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect objects, follow their movement over time, and label them accurately. By incorporating object recognition and tracking, video labelling systems enable precise annotation of objects, contributing to the development of robust datasets for training machine learning models.</p>

                    <h2>Semantic Segmentation</h2>
                    <p class="tech-text">Semantic Segmentation is an advanced video labelling feature that goes beyond simple object recognition. This involves classifying and labelling each pixel within a video frame based on its semantic meaning. By segmenting the video into meaningful parts, such as identifying different objects and their boundaries, semantic segmentation enhances the granularity and accuracy of video labelling. This feature is particularly valuable for applications where precise object delineation is crucial.</p>

                <section id="service3" class="service__main-section">
                    <h2>Temporal Annotation for Action Recognition</h2>
                    <p class="tech-text">Temporal Annotation for Action Recognition is a feature that focuses on labelling and understanding the temporal aspects of actions within video sequences. This involves annotating specific actions or events as they unfold over time. By accurately marking the start and end points of actions, temporal annotation facilitates the training of machine learning models for action recognition, enabling systems to understand and respond to dynamic scenarios in videos.</p>

                <section id="service4" class="service__main-section">
                    <h2>Multi-Modal Labelling</h2>
                    <p class="tech-text">Multi-Modal Labelling involves annotating videos with information from multiple modalities, such as audio, text, or sensor data. This feature enhances the overall understanding of video content by incorporating diverse sources of information. For example, in a video labelling application, multi-modal labelling could involve annotating spoken words or background music along with visual annotations. This comprehensive approach provides a richer dataset for training and analysis.</p>

                <section id="service5" class="service__main-section">
                    <h2>Anomaly Detection and Labelling</h2>
                    <p class="tech-text">Anomaly Detection and Labelling is a feature that focuses on identifying and labelling unusual or abnormal events within video footage. This involves training models to recognize patterns associated with normal activities and then labelling deviations from these patterns as anomalies. By incorporating anomaly detection and labelling, video labelling systems can automatically highlight and categorize unusual occurrences, contributing to the development of effective surveillance and security applications.</p>
