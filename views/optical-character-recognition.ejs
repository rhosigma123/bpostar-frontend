                    <h2>Text Detection</h2>
                    <p class="tech-text">Text Detection is a foundational feature in OCR systems that involves locating and identifying text regions within images or documents. This process utilizes computer vision techniques to identify the boundaries of text elements. Accurate text detection is crucial for extracting meaningful information from images and facilitating subsequent OCR processes.</p>

                <section id="service2" class="service__main-section">
                    <h2>Character Segmentation</h2>
                    <p class="tech-text">Character Segmentation is the process of breaking down the detected text regions into individual characters. This feature involves analyzing the layout and spacing of characters to separate them effectively. Accurate character segmentation is essential for ensuring that each character is recognized independently, improving the overall precision of the OCR system.</p>

                </section>
                <section id="service3" class="service__main-section">
                    <h2>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Engine</h2>
                    <p class="tech-text">The OCR Engine is the core component that performs the actual recognition of characters from images or scanned documents. This feature employs sophisticated algorithms, often based on machine learning and neural networks, to interpret the visual patterns of characters. The OCR engine plays a pivotal role in converting images containing text into machine-readable and editable text data.</p>

                <section id="service4" class="service__main-section">
                    <h2>Language Support and Model Training</h2>
                    <p class="tech-text">Language Support and Model Training involve optimizing OCR systems to recognize characters in specific languages or scripts. This feature requires training the OCR model with relevant datasets to improve its accuracy and recognition capabilities for diverse languages. Robust language support ensures that OCR systems can effectively process and extract text from documents in multiple languages.</p>

                </section>
                <section id="service5" class="service__main-section">
                    <h2>Post-Processing and Correction</h2>
                    <p class="tech-text">Post-Processing and Correction features are crucial for refining OCR results. This involves implementing algorithms to correct errors, enhance text formatting, and improve the overall quality of recognized text. Post-processing steps contribute to the accuracy and reliability of OCR outputs, especially in scenarios where the initial recognition may contain errors or inaccuracies.</p>
