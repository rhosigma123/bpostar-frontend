                    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently a major point of discussion within call centers. There are strategic discussions about its potential application in customer service, concerns about the impact on jobs, and ethical considerations surrounding the displacement of human workers. These debates are happening in boardrooms worldwide. However, despite the extensive discussions and planning, AI is still in its early stages, and the excitement and anticipation surrounding it often exceed the actual progress, according to Gartner's Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies.</p>
                    <p>AI is the latest buzzword that technology companies and marketing firms are eagerly incorporating into their content and sales pitches as the latest essential innovation. The call center industry is familiar with such high expectations for technology promising to address service issues and reduce labor costs by replacing agents with software or applications. In the late 1990s, online support was hailed as the successor to call centers. A decade ago, social media was touted as the new replacement for call centers. Yet, call centers remain a vital part of the industry.</p>
                    <h3>Is Human Interaction in Call Centers Coming to an End?</h3>
                    <p>We are skeptical of the overly optimistic claims made by technology companies suggesting the end of human interaction in call centers. Such statements are, in our view, irresponsible rhetoric. We don't foresee a scenario where robots like R2D2 replace human agents anytime soon.</p>
                    <p>Studies have indicated that the average consumer prefers interacting with a live agent over a chatbot. A recent Forrester survey found that if given a choice, 83% of consumers would rather speak to a human agent because humans better understand their needs (78%) and can address multiple questions simultaneously (57%). Consumers reported that the top three issues with bots were their inability to handle complex requests, provide personalized offers like humans, and understand human emotions.</p>
                    <p>However, it would be unwise to disregard the potential impact of automation in call centers, especially when AI is combined with robotic process automation (RPA). <b>We believe that call center agents will continue to play a crucial role in the customer journey, and technology will progressively be used to enhance human performance in call centers, resulting in more efficient, effective, and value-added experiences.</b></p>
                    <h3>Distinguishing Fiction from Reality: Understanding AI & RPA</h3>
                    <p>Defining AI can be a complex task, as different people have varying interpretations. Many of the extravagant claims, exaggerations, and fears regarding AI result from differences in understanding its nature and potential applications in the call center.</p>
                    <p>To grasp how AI and RPA can collaborate with human agents to enhance service delivery, it's essential to clarify their meanings in the context of call centers. Here's what we believe these technologies represent:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Artificial intelligence (AI) involves a machine's ability to replicate human sensory perception, decision-making, and communication. AI is a judgment-based technology designed to think and act as a human would.</li>
                        <li>Robotic process automation (RPA) is software that emulates human behavior. RPA operates with structured inputs and follows rules. RPA focuses on "doing" rather than "thinking."</li>
                    </ol>
