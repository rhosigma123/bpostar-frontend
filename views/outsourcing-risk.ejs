                    <p>The decision whether to outsource all or part of your call center has far-reaching consequences
                        for your company. It is one of the most impactful calls a leader can make.

                        Create the right partnership and the business will reap the rewards of increased efficiency,
                        lower operating costs and quality customer service. Your company will be able to focus on core
                        competencies and innovation, giving it a competitive edge in the market.</p>
                    <p>An uninformed or hasty decision, on the other hand, may damage your brand and put your greatest
                        asset—your customers—at risk.

                        Outsourcing does not necessarily mean offshoring—it means using a third party to handle call
                        center functions irrespective of location. Outsourcing your call center within the USA does
                        mitigate some risks, but not all. Low unemployment in the USA is impacting call centers and
                        poses a major challenge in the years ahead as long as our economy keeps improving.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to customer-facing functions, there are often perceived risks associated with
                        outsourcing nearshore and offshore in particular. These can often be traced back to an “allergic
                        reaction” to nearshore and offshore call centers, caused by a knee-jerk reaction rooted in
                        outdated stereotypes or media hype.

                        Perceptions aside, outsourcing does pose some real risks for companies that fail to thoroughly
                        assess and select a vendor that matches their needs. The following are a few common risks
                        associated with outsourcing.</p>
                    <h2>Risks of Outsourcing?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Loss of Control</h5>
                    <p> In today’s customers-first world, superior customer service is often intertwined with the brand
                        image. It’s no surprise that company leaders are reluctant to hand over the reins for the call
                        center—often a company’s only human touchpoint—to a third party.</p>
                    <p>After all, how can the outsourcer’s agents have the same commitment to customers as internal
                        staff who share the same workplace culture, mission and goals? Service leaders who are far
                        removed from the frontline staff may feel that they lack the ability to engage agents and
                        effectively communicate information about products and services, new releases, promotions and
                        policy changes.</p>
                    <h5>Compromised Service Quality</h5>
                    <p>Compromised service quality is often a side effect of choosing a vendor solely based on price.
                        Outsourcers that focus on delivering the lowest price are going to cut corners—that might mean
                        hiring less-qualified employees, skimping on training time or employing fewer supervisors for
                        monitoring and coaching.</p>

                    <h5>Data Breaches</h5>
                    <p>These days, data breaches are always in the news. It’s no wonder that cybersecurity and
                        protecting customer data are at the top of every executive’s mind. Sharing sensitive information
                        with outsourcers that lack robust security systems and protocols will most certainly put
                        customer data at risk. The cost to the business will be high in both reputation and money.</p>
                    <h5>Violating Regulatory Compliance</h5>
                    <p>Whether it’s the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Health Insurance
                        Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of
                        1991 (TCPA) or an industry-specific regulation, using an outsourced call center that violates
                        compliance standards can result in hefty fines for your business.

                        And the penalties are growing. Earlier this year, the FTC announced an increase in the maximum
                        civil fine for violations of the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) from $40,654 to $41,484, along
                        with several other fines that the FTC enforces. The increase is part of a predetermined formula
                        that will adjust fines upward for inflation every year.
